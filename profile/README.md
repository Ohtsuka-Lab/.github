We work on the theory and practice of modeling, analysis, design, and control of a wide variety of dynamical systems. We investigate theory to solve universal and fundamental problems as well as find solutions to practical problems of social importance. We deal with systems in various fields: automobiles, robots, satellites, waste water processes, and people's electricity consumption behavior in electric power systems. We are actively collaborating with domestic and overseas research organizations and companies.
